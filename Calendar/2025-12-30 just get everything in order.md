hey, everything is misordered, so get everything in order, you dont procrastinate because of lack of things to do, you do it because of lack of direction, so get a direction, even a sparse one would do, even from gemini would do , but just get things in order.

things to prioritize:
- [ ] scholarship form
- [ ] ai agent project
- [ ] job exit plan


checklist:
- [ ] watch improvement videos
	- [x] 1
	- [ ] 2
- [x] bs on how to measure good habit application (hint: by making a checklist of calendar type checkboxes), 
- [ ]
