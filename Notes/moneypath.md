paths to consider:
1. upwork
2. tidb agentx hackathon
3. micro-saas
4. looking for work on reddit
5. instead of just product ideas from reddit, i can gather pain problems, and i can give it as a lead magnet. 


how to proceed? (respectively)
1. you can checkout which projects to make in make and zapier and n8n, and then make them to make a portfolio, and then apply for jobs
2. you can make the project,  and wait for the hackathon result
3. you can check out the market reports, and then make micro saas's out of it
4. you can "lurk" on reddit, or scrape reddit posts, and find clients for your work.//for that first make a good portfolio//you really need to make some real world projects, atleast 3. (agentic ones!)
5. findout how to utilize reddit data, either to make a blog, or some content, or some sellable lead magnet!
