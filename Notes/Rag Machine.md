## Components
- Features
	- chunk cache system to retrieve frequently chunks faster and cheaper
	- db index streaming(streaming db index as a static file, or a static json, which tells the structure of the stored files, so the client can know what files or chunks to index)

- Parsers
	- [ ] code parsers
		- [ ] potential solution :tree-sitter
		- [ ] python code parser
		- [ ] JS parser 
		- [ ] C, C++ parser
		- [ ] other language common parser
	- [ ] md parser
	- [ ] book parser
	
- Workflows
	- [ ] how to use embeddings model to retrieve the chunks 
	- [ ] hybrid retrieval 
	- [ ] code repo parsing workflow
		- [ ] ingesting a zip file
		- [ ] extracting it
		- [ ] examining file-tree
		- [ ] knowing which files to ignore, from .gitignore/other approach
		- [ ] parsing files and storing them in a (graph db if needed!)
	- [ ] book indexing
	- [ ] simple plain md indexing
	- [ ] simple plain text indexing
	- [ ] pdf indexing
		- [ ] OCR fallback for images in pdf
		- [ ] robust table and excel parsing 
	- [ ] excel indexing
