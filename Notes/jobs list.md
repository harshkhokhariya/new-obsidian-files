**Summary**

About Us  
We are a growing real estate investment and property management company managing multiple projects, clients, and vendors across different locations. As our operations expand, we’re looking to replace spreadsheets and manual processes with an automated system that centralizes data, improves visibility, and saves our team valuable time.  
  
Role Overview  
We need an Automation Specialist to design and implement a system that connects our CRM, project tracking, and reporting tools into one streamlined platform. The ideal candidate will leverage Airtable, Monday.com, and Make.com (Integromat) to create workflows that reduce manual work, eliminate data silos, and ensure smooth collaboration between our sales, property management, and finance teams.  
  
Key Responsibilities  
  
Build a custom Airtable database to manage properties, tenants, investors, and transactions.  
  
Design Monday.com boards and workflows for project tracking (renovations, property onboarding, leasing, etc.).  
  
Automate repetitive processes (e.g., tenant onboarding, document generation, rent reminders) using Make.com.  
  
Integrate external apps (Google Workspace, QuickBooks Online, Slack, Calendly, etc.) into the system for seamless data flow.  
  
Set up dashboards and reports for leadership to monitor KPIs like occupancy rate, rent collection, and project timelines.  
  
Provide documentation and light training for the internal team to manage and scale the system.  
  
Requirements  
  
Proven experience building workflow automations with Airtable, Monday.com, and Make.com.  
  
Ability to map business processes and translate them into automated workflows.  
  
Familiarity with CRM systems and experience integrating tools via APIs or webhooks.  
  
Strong problem-solving skills with a knack for spotting inefficiencies and streamlining them.  
  
Bonus: Experience with real estate, construction, or project management workflows.  
  
Example Projects You’ll Work On  
  
Automating lead capture → CRM entry → sales pipeline tracking.  
  
Creating an investor dashboard in Airtable to show portfolio performance.  
  
Building an automated tenant onboarding workflow: lease signed → welcome email → task creation in Monday.com.  
  
Syncing financial data between QuickBooks and Airtable for real-time reporting.  
  
Compensation  
  
Contract role ($20/hr depending on experience).  
  
Opportunity to transition into long-term system management and optimization.
