- do not wait for a sign or a reason to tell everyone to change , you can change anytime, you are not attached, or you dont have any strings attached with the past, only thing that is tangible is now, the seconds that are passing by
- ongoing processes(health, disciplined activities) need constant effort to maintain them. 
- you bad habits fulfill a perceived need, so the problem is not your bbad habit, but the main problem is that you are choosing that bad habit to fulfill your perceived need
