### 3. The Final, Automated, Local-First Architecture

The ultimate, most advanced technical pivot adopted to maximize cost-efficiency and control:

*   **Architecture Principle:** **Fully Local, Zero-Cost, Three-Stage Pipeline.** (Removes dependency on expensive online LLMs like Gemini for the core loop).
*   **Key Tooling:** **Ollama** (for local LLMs like Phi-3 and Llama 3) and **SQLite** (the `SQLite-first` approach for fast, queryable data storage).
*   **The Golden Path Workflow (The Final, Executable Mandate):**
    1.  **`daily_run.py` (The Heartbeat):** Orchestrator syncs users from Google Sheets/Carrd and updates the data cache.
    2.  **LLM Pipeline (The Cost-Control Engine):** Uses a **Batch-Optimized Map-Reduce Pipeline** with a **Self-Correcting Synthesis (SCS) Protocol** (Draft $\rightarrow$ Critique $\rightarrow$ Refine) to ensure the final report is high-quality without costly re-analysis.
    3.  **Monetization Stack (Compliance):** **Dodo Payments** (Merchant of Record) handles global sales tax and compliance, allowing you to sell globally from India without a US entity.
