For infinite scroll, or some sites for which you need to scrape by clicking a button, you can use a browser extension like Easy Scraper(i am not the builder), for scraping sites, i use it, because it is easy and has options to get output in json, and csv.

Man, that's a brutal lesson. Sincerely appreciate you sharing it. That $200k pain of not finding the right pain points is the exact reason I started building Community Insights.

Just checked out Leonata – it looks incredibly solid. The focus on deterministic, offline knowledge graphs for high-stakes industries is a massive differentiator in a world of hallucinating LLMs. That "no surprises" value prop is killer.

I was trying to make a knowledge base tool for my another project, and i needed a way to have a way to extract data from scattered documents, so maybe i'd try Leonata soon.

The marketing hurdle is real for so many technical founders. They are mostly focussed on product rather than the user, so that's why apart from pain points and opportunities, i also added the target audience's primary goals, and what solutions have they tried, and shortcomings of those solutions.

I also tried to add, how do they even talk about their problems, in a certain way, so founders atleast know how their target audience talks.

Open to connect for Collab if you need any help.

Maybe the platform just take its listing fees( minimal ) and both the parties keep their side of finders fees , so win-win-win, 

And I think these specific type of transactions would make the website more and more popular

Hey, Thanks to all of the people who are loving these ideas, Apart from these ideas only, i also have put together user pain points, Target audience profile, and existing tools people already use to solve their problems, and also where they lack functionality,

so i would like to have some feedbacks, on how to improve the reports.

no, it means if i want a limited edition bike/car/thing, or something that is not listed on online platforms, or is not easily available,

this might be also when someone wants to sell something in bulk, like sawdust, in bulk, and it might be useful for some people , like who would be making sawdust pellets, so if a person connects, the buyer, and seller, he gets a commision for making the transaction happen.

Hey, this is exactly the kind of critical feedback that's super valuable. Thank you for taking the time to break down each idea. I'd love to share some of the context from the community discussions I analyzed.

> A Universal Concert Payment System - this idea is probably good if researched more, especially on the implementation for end users. How would it work in practice?

You're right, adoption is the biggest hurdle. The core pain point I saw was less about the _wait time_ to pay and more about the _setup friction_ and _lost money_. People hate having to queue up to add money to a wristband only to have a balance left over that they can't get back.

The initial user base wouldn't be individuals, but the event organizers themselves. The pitch to them is an integrated system that reduces their own cash handling, provides them with valuable spending data, and increases attendee satisfaction. For the user, the card would ideally be something they can get at the first event and then just top-up via an app for any future event that uses the same system.

> Sales reps, especially new ones, freeze up on live calls. My solution would be to run AI completely to run the chat.

That's a great point, and fully autonomous AI sales agents are definitely a huge emerging market. The specific pain point I found, though, was for teams that still want a human touch for closing deals but need support _during_ the call. The "whisper" idea is a lower-risk entry point – it's a co-pilot, not a replacement. It helps the human rep build confidence and handle tricky questions without the risk of a fully autonomous agent going off the rails with a key client.

> Podcasters put in a ton of effort to interview guests, - sounds reasonable but I believe such tools already exist, and podcasters should be just educated about them.

Totally agree that tools exist, but the frustration I saw was that they're either part of a huge, expensive suite or they're not automated enough. The specific problem was hosts manually creating assets (quote cards, audiograms, etc.) and then having to chase down the guest to post them. The opportunity is a simple, fire-and-forget tool that automates both the asset creation AND the delivery/reminder to the guest, making it seamless for both sides.

> Medical offices are drowning in scanned paper documents - is it really still a problem? In my clinic, all the documents are digital.

That's awesome that your clinic is fully digital! What I found in the `r/HealthIT` and `r/practicemanagement` communities is that while the main EHR/EMR is digital, there's still a massive influx of "digital paper"—faxes, scanned referrals from other offices, old records, etc. These get saved as flat PDFs or images. So, while the file is digital, the _text inside_ isn't searchable. The pain point is staff having to manually open and read hundreds of these files to find one piece of information, because their system can't search the content.

Really appreciate the thoughtful questions. It's exactly this kind of pushback that helps refine an idea from a concept into something viable. Thanks again!

Maybe you should do some "safe" promotion or give value to people in productivity communities, you may get users faster.

But please do not just pitch them directly, you will get banned permanently from some subs if you do!

Thanks for the awesome reply!

Yeah, when someone has problems, and they want to build a product, and no one wants to buy that product,

it maybe because, the problems they are facing is because of their unique situation.

and in that case, founders need to deep down in their niche, to know exactly what problems, and that too why!

and it can be easily done by asking the person who is facing the problem firsthand, and who does the thing for his living, not as a hobby.

for customer acquisition, the most important thing is the distribution channel, many founders try to promote their product on reddit while their primary audience is on x, or insta, or discord.

so before going all in founders need to just get an overall bird's eye view of their audience, so it does not feel directionless.

and when creating and analyzing these reports for many communities, similar to SaaS(MicroSaaS, startups, indiehackers etc.)

i have found that the most successful founders put a lot of weight on distribution channel,

whereas the first time founders, or founders struggling, are either very product/idea focussed, or dont know their audience well enough.

Marketing is an area where I, Myself am trying to improve, so  I have found a way, 

because I have a program that extracts business ideas from reddit threads, 

I have slightly modified it, and made a program/script that finds reddit threads which are talking about the problem for which the product description is inserted, 

so I would use that extensively, and I also am thinking that maybe give that as a service, 

so I think maybe this helps: find discussions related to the problem that your product is trying to solve, and add value.

A Legit Finder's fee platform, there is really need for a 2 way platform which lets you list the products that you have, and want to sell, or post for a product that you need, and when someone finds you that product, you give the finder his commission( finder's fee). 

I came across a site named findersfee .com but I don't think it is THAT Legit, or because I only see things like expensive cars, and luxury items costing 10k+ , so I don't think this business has reached at scale yet

I would love to have listings for products that are in the range of between 1k-5k or 10k.

Make the business, and sell it on micro startup marketplaces like microns, or even just make a thread on reddit, many people like Greg isenberg are looking for businesses that generate revenue, with minimal maintenance or workload. 

People like those would love to buy revenue generating businesses.

You should just listen to users , when they are complaining, and asking for features in already existing apps, you get so many insights from their conversation in help forums, and online communities(also subreddits)

[[Validate My Idea] A tool that auto-generates a dev portfolio from your AI chats](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1nanl22/validate_my_idea_a_tool_that_autogenerates_a_dev/) by [downzoo](https://www.reddit.com/user/downzoo) in [indiehackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/)

[–][harsh_khokhariya](https://www.reddit.com/user/harsh_khokhariya) 2 points 11 days ago 

Yes, this would be a good idea, because recently when i was applying to an internship, i told gemini to make me my new resume, from the exact chat that i was using to make my personal project,

and i told it to check if i am a good fit for it or not?, so yes, when updating the resume, it really is useful to get context from assistant messages.

privacy is not a concern majorly, but the llm integration option would be a plus too, because, then the devs would integrate the llm which they are already using, so there is nothing about privacy you have to worry about.

but the main concern is, that would anyone pay for it?

maybe, or maybe not? but it can be a fantastic lead magnet for other products, which get into the process of resume, job application etc.

so keep it up, and dont waste more than 2 weeks to launch your mvp!

content creators are having problems managing admin work, and day-to-day operational tasks such as scheduling posts,

and responding to emails, and updating various platform stats, so you can make something for them , they are already using tools like:

**Buffer/Later** [saves time but still requires batch creation, manual content scheduling],

**Notion** [good for organization, but gets overwhelming with freelance editors and feedback rounds, tough for visual review],

**Syllaby** [brainstorms ideas, creates faceless videos, schedules them, but implies less control over creative process],

**Trendradar** [surfaces trending topics by scanning tweets/news, but focuses on tweets, might need niche filtering], and more, but almost each tool has its flaws, so you can fill the gap!

and they are also having problems like: inefficient content repurposing, lack of content idea generation and consistency of content, uncertainty of algorithm etc.

so you can also make products for them too!

Thanks, I appreciate that. and the approach you are talking about is a solid advice, so if i add recurring questions, would you find the report more valuable?

Yeah, the pain of making a good product, and not getting enough attention is real. i also thought, to track reddit usernames, for you know, which are the potential people, but then i thought, i should only focus, on Analysis, and pain points, and your tool is also good btw, and i think it would be interesting to see how these tools help founder get to their PMF fast. website design is also good, one-page landing page, so it did not took too long to understand your product.

Thanks for the valuable feedback!

I had already seen many founders just build products and not achieving Product-Market Fit, so I thought why start on an Idea, when I can start building for a problem, so i made this tool: Reddit Analyzer link:[https://github.com/harshkhokhariya/Reddit_Analyzer](https://github.com/harshkhokhariya/Reddit_Analyzer) (open-source btw) so the full analysis for 100+ posts takes <5 mins, but i was doing this weekly, for 10-15 different subreddits, scanning 20 posts daily, so it was only 10 minutes(automated, while i do some other work)

And I Observed that setting this up, was a bit technical, so most people couldn't set it up, so i would now try to analyze subs on-demand, and sent it as a newsletter, and it's almost free on my end, as long as i dont hit reddit api limits. I am also willing to extend it for other communities, but i just want to know which ones have good insights:discord, Indiehackers, etc.

So will set up newsletter in this week, and will notify soon!

hey, thanks for the appreciation, i have the demo report in the repo itself, so you know how it looks like.

for the process, it's almost lean: fetch top 15 or 10 hot posts(can be configured), send them to llm with a prompt for extracting business ideas and pain points, and also it can save the fetched reddit posts, so you can upload it to any llm for deep dives. or just if you want to read. and saving posts is not very beautified, it just saves in a text file, i will improve it later, maybe.

i use the python script to fetch posts using praw(python reddit api wrapper), and i then send those posts and comments to the llm to extract the business opportunities! and in the reports they generate, the llm also mentions comments for specific problems.

or maybe they have some other things that separate them from this model (arch-router)?

just found a similar project, you should check it out, i think it may help you make your next set of models

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1mle65k/stop_using_llms_for_simple_classification_built/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1mle65k/stop_using_llms_for_simple_classification_built/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

the above is not exactly same, but similar one

congrats!

i think its [r/automation](https://www.reddit.com/r/automation), so you should do some reddit automation to fetch links from your post's comments and give ratings under it.

how would be that idea?

[–][harsh_khokhariya](https://www.reddit.com/user/harsh_khokhariya) 2 points 1 month ago 

not using SmolAgents as a Whole,

but extracted its localPythonExecutor module, (with utils, and other necessary components)

so i basically converted the inter-dependent module , in a separate and standalone module, and i am just using that to make my code agents, because, i dont like the basic smolagents codeagent working process

so i wanted to make my agents more controllable, so i am just making separate components for code execution, memory, and thinking.

even as a whole, smolagents is a very good library, which gives many tools , in a small form factor, not as bloated as other frameworks

so A HUGE THANKS to Huggingface Team

Thanks , i am going to improve it further, and this was the minimal MVP I could get out as soon as possible,

as i had the script already for months, just made some edits, so its easy for others to run it.

so, thanks for the suggestions

yeah, i will, in coming weeks, and i am also thinking , i will just post these reports, but in a better format, in a blog like website, so no one has to setup all these, if they just want one or 2 subreddit reports.

i just made it public, i already had this script since months,

and i made it public for those founders who spend months building a product, and then get no users because their product does not have any demand.

so if not useful for everyone, it will be useful for people who dont want to waste their precious time building products no one wants

Amazing models for the size!

hey, but can you tell me how to fix the models not generating voice for the last 1 sec, or so, it just breaks there, so a fix would be very appreciated!

made a python script which fetches top 15 hot posts of each subreddit i listed in an array, fetches posts+comments, and saves them in a file, and parallely sends those posts to gemini for problem extraction, and finding potential business ideas, and then it receives the response, and it saves into md file with date in name, so i can read it in obsidian, date-wise.

it saves me 15+ hours every week scrolling through reddit, looking for something interesting to work on!

Most people make agent memory, only limited to conversation history, but it should also contain:

function descriptions

user details

previous chat summary(summary of the chats that is out of current memory)

and much more, and we cant fit this into the array of "system","user", "assistant" message blocks

we need to develop a much more robust memory system.

regarding tool use and debugging, anyone who knows how to handle errors efficiently, can just set guardrails, and handle errors elegantly,

and when it comes to agent collaboration, i think we should give agents a message recieving and message sending system, so they can do messaging like us (like we humans do in whatsapp!)

nah, just testing them one by one, just "vibe testing", which would be the best fit for speed and instruction following, locally!

i tested them for making an ai agent, so i just used my laptop with ryzen 5600h, and rtx 3050 laptop gpu, and i mostly run them using laptop because i want my agent to run locally, and when i want to test online inference, i mostly use groq and cerebras, and i love the speed cerebras offers!

qwen4b16k:latest

qwen4b:latest

qwen3:0.6b

gemma3:latest

phi4-mini:latest

deep1.58k:latest

deepseek8k:latest

exa8k:latest

deep4k:latest

deep8k:latest

exaone:latest

deephermes:latest

llama1b4k:latest

llama3.2:1b

deepseek:latest

llama8k:latest

smol:latest

tiny:latest

phi3.5mini:latest

llama:latest

deepseek-r1:1.5b

moondream:latest

nomic-embed-text:latest

but i rarely use most of them,

qwen4b8k for function calling, and other tasks, i tried gemma, but it was chatty, and couldn't follow instructions properly, not as much as qwen4b. also when i dont want quick responses, i like to use deephermes model, with thinking prompt.

exactly! people think AI Agents are some type of new Artificial creatures, but all they are , just programs, so no need to create new interfaces, just using apis would get you far far ahead, than creating a whole new infrastructure for these Agents!

go to gemini, and paste all your concepts, and ask it to convert it to code, one-by-one, one function at a time. i have been doing this , and i am getting progress faster, and accurately than just "vibe coding"/ llm coding (i hate the term too!)

A MCP server which can create new functions and save it in it's own registry, so we have new functions by just converting API calls into MCP functions, this would work for most of the APIs and applications of not All!

Yeah right! I am also so annoyed by llms that write code that I now try to be the project manager, and I make the llm create functions in isolation and then I tell it to organize those functions, as I want. We can't give the llm whole project information and expect it to return it full code, and that also as we expect it to run!

i dont want all the fancy ask it and all that, i just need it to analyze a subreddit, and extract the pain points, and all the topics that the users are asking for, i can do the further research , but manually reading every post, and scrolling through mindless comments, to find some gold, or useful stuff, wears me out.

so only one functionality would be enough! i know this is not soooo hard, but i dont have that much consistency, and dedication for this project, but if i can find a way to monetize it, without hindering its "open source" origin, then i think i will have enough drive to this project!

for that exactly, we need to give it access to memory, and able to write to its memory, and edit.

for long term memory, we should use some sort of database, or for mvp , just a text, or JSON file, and then when we need the memory(bitcoin/binance related block), the agent uses a memory search function to find the memory, and appends the memory block to its current working context.

choose a llm with a large context window, (gemini models have 1-2 million, and also we have qwen models with 1m context window),

let it take actions in code (like smolagents library from huggingface ),

put the system prompt, and memory modules in some sort of database, or local text files, which the agent can modify over time, or as needed,

give it access to internet search(ddgs), and access to knowledge bases. make a system effectively store the knowledge, so it store the data in meaningful blocks, so when the agent needs specific data, it only retrieves that blocks.

and some more features as you like, and the agent will be able to build more features, by itself, because it has access to its own system prompt, its own memory, and internet .

So, that's the recipe for your little cute AGI!

I think that will make collaboration for making a super llm easier.

if you are talking about 3b, yes it is!

for its size, its very good, means if i want it to make a choice, and i prompt, it like

[choice1, choice2, choice3], and i say 1 for choice 1 , two for choice2, 3 for choice3, only reply in numbers,

then it nails it everytime. so for if else, or routing, or simple robust workflows, it is very good. and also it is very good overall as an llm of its size

anywhere you can deploy python!

try it out, it is simpler compared to others, and you can also do rag and embeddings with ease!

I use llamaindex, because it has integration for almost all llms, and it also has many options for llm calls, like completion, chat, streaming.

And also vector embeddings and all other features are also relatively easy to do!

Hey, the main issue here is not a  technical issue, its a system design issue, i want to store function features, tips, knowledge bases, and chat history, and log history.

I know about vector embeddings and vector databases, but it doesnt solve the issue of the structure of the components.

Coding is just manufacturing software for ideas,

so as we delegated Manufacturing products for ideas(production machines),

I think, we should also delegate manufacturing software for ideas,

so it will free up all os us to to focus on generating new ideas, or combination of ideas

I think, if after some sort of "threshold", if adding more parameters, only increase the factual accuracy, or knowledge, then i think small models should be connected to a knowledge base as wiki, and they should beat the bigger proprietary models easily!

has anyone found something similar to this?

This _post_ was intended to help out people who are at starting of their AI Journey, and just getting them on board.

I think in future, we could just "DOWNLOAD" AGI into our BRAINS, that could make us type 1, 2, or even type 3 civilisation, and help us control galactic energy resources, to run the VVVLLMs in our brains that we would download and run on bio-neural processing units with tera-zeta operations per millisecond speed.

These are the things where , we software engineers need to "GRIND" for finding the ideal solution, or even an mvp, so others can push it forward.

I think most innovative things come from a place of absolute scarcity, where you need to do it or you die,

or from a place of absolute luxury, where you are soo bored of the normal stuff, you want to push things to its EDGE!!!

AND see where it leads!

This field is so new, that even top players don't know if they are at the top, or are at the bottom, upside down, held by a rope at their legs!

everything is very spontaneous and volatile at this stage, but to get a good idea, just keep reading new papers released for this, and keep experimenting with llms, until you get it!

Yeah, in that case, I think people trust more on Hype than on the Real Productivity.

for Fun we can make 25 agents distributed over 8 servers , in each continent ,

and requesting from agent 1 to agent 25, sequentially,

sending 1000 characters hashed code,

which decodes to hello world,

to see if any of the characters were not hallucinated by any so-called "Agents"!!!!!

Exactly!! we need to just use llms just as another function of programming, and we should use them to evaluate natural language tasks.

I also am very impressed with [https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance), which lets us use llms as an if else loop, means pure programming concepts can be applied to AI applications.

I am not a big fan of giving every decision to llms, just want to make everything as predictable as possible, and just trying to use llms as "PROCESSING ENGINE"s of an application.

so they let me do things normal python doesn't let me do, like making decisions based on natural language queries, generating poems and scripts, and talking like a Waifu!

Yes! Llama index is much cleaner and useful
