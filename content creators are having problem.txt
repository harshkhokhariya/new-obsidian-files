content creators are having problems managing admin work,  and day-to-day operational tasks such as scheduling posts, and responding to emails, and updating various platform stats, so you can make something for them , they are already using tools like: 
Buffer/Later [saves time but still requires batch creation, manual content scheduling], 
Notion [good for organization, but gets overwhelming with freelance editors and feedback rounds, tough for visual review],
Syllaby [brainstorms ideas, creates faceless videos, schedules them, but implies less control over creative process],
Trendradar [surfaces trending topics by scanning tweets/news, but focuses on tweets, might need niche filtering],
and more, but almost each tool has its flaws, so you can fill the gap!

+ they are having problems like: inefficient content repurposing, lack of content idea generation and consistency of content, uncertainty of algorithm etc. 

so you can also make products for them too!

and this is only for content creators, you can also check out reports including:
pain points

potential monetization models 
and much more....
